This project was solely made for the purpose of studying runtimes of different algorithms under certain circumstances and conditions such as threading and big N values for sorting/searching in arrays.

The algorithms used in this project are well known and commonly used algorithms for searching and sorting, and the implementations I used are the ones on geeksforgeeks.org


FOR SORTING ALGORITHMS:\
    &emsp;&emsp;To get started, configure the following in "results.py":\
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;-N: Number of randomly generated integers to sort.\
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;-numIteration: Number of randomly generated arrays to be sorted, tested, and averaged over.\
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;-threading: Disable/Enable threading. If enabled, each algorithm will generate and perform its task on a new thread.\
    &emsp;&emsp;Then, run "results.py"

FOR SEARCHING ALGORITHMS:\
    &emsp;&emsp;NOT IMPLEMENTED
