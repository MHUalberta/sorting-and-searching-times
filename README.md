This project was solely made for the purpose of studying runtimes of different algorithms under certain circumstances and conditions such as threading and big N values for sorting/searching in arrays.

The algorithms used in this project are well known and commonly used algorithms for searching and sorting, and the implementations I used are the ones on geeksforgeeks.org


FOR SORTING ALGORITHMS:
    To get started, configure the following in "results.py":
        -N: Number of randomly generated integers to sort.
        -numIteration: Number of randomly generated arrays to be sorted, tested, and averaged over.
        -threading: Disable/Enable threading. If enabled, each algorithm will generate and perform its task on a new thread.

FOR SEARCHING ALGORITHMS:
    NOT IMPLEMENTED
